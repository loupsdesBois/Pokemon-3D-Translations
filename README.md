Pokemon-3D-Translations
=======================

This is a place to update or add tokens files for pokemon 3d's localization. 

If you are adding a language you need to make a copy of tokens_en.dat and rename that copy to the right suffix for your language

for example
ru - russian
it - italian
es - spanish
pl - polish
nl - dutch
id - indonesian
jp - japanese
ch - chinese

If you are making a correction find the language file you want and make the change to the tokens you see mistakes in then commit and push the changes.

No matter what you are doing, give a detailed commit message, and say who you are on the p3d forums.
